## ⚠️ EMERGENCY GUIDANCE FOR MODERATORS

2. Suggest they go to the nearest emergency room
3. Ask if there's someone nearby who can stay with them
4. Provide the crisis hotline numbers above

**Active Listening Tips:**
- Take all mentions of suicide seriously

- Encourage professional help
- Follow up when appropriate

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't leave the person alone if possible
- Don't debate whether suicide is right or wrong
