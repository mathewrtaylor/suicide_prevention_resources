## ⚠️ EMERGENCY GUIDANCE FOR MODERATORS

3. Ask if there's someone nearby who can stay with them
4. Provide the crisis hotline numbers above

**Active Listening Tips:**
- Take all mentions of suicide seriously
- Listen without judgment
- Don't promise confidentiality if safety is at risk
- Encourage professional help
- Follow up when appropriate

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't leave the person alone if possible
- Don't debate whether suicide is right or wrong
- Don't act shocked or judgmental
- Don't promise you can keep their thoughts a secret
